	<h2>What is LoRa</h2>

	<p>LoRa stands for long range, and it is the communications method of the Lethbridge LoRa System. LoRa allows for the transmission of data from sensors over long distances while still consuming very little power, thus making it perfect for long term sensors and projects that will be deployed and not physically maintained for things like battery changes for long periods of time.</p>
	
	
	<h2>What is the Iddon LoRa Network?</h2>
    <p>The Iddon LoRa Network is a network of connected sensors and other devices utilizing the LoRa as the communications method to transfer data and commands. The network is being built to cover specific regions in the Elk Valley area.</p>

    <h2>Who am I?</h2>
    <p>That's a fantastic question I often ask too. My name is John Iddon and I'm a physicist currently working in the Elk Valley area. I am a certified computer technician, and have a great interest in electronics. With my background, a deployable LoRa based sensor network seemed like an interesting project to undertake, and a useful system to develop for my own use as well as the use of others. I began development of the network back in the summer of 2019, and am currently continuing its development.</p>
